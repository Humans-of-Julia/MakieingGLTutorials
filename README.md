# Makieing GL Tutorials

An unofficial tutorial for Makie from existing but outdated JuliaGL and other graphics related Julia packages.

## Goals

- Migrate towards Makie. Most effort to use GL abstractions and constructs are now in [Makie.jl](https://makie.org/).
Hence, it would be wise to transfer outdated tutorials to use Makie.
- Make it easy. We plan to make this tutorial as dumb as possible. *There will be some exceptions*.
- Make it community-driven. We plan that Humans of Julia and other Julia community members help collaborate in this effort.
